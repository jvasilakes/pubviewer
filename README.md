# PubViewer

Plenty of text datasets are released in PubTator format, but
[PubTator Central](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/research/pubtator/index.html)
no longer lets you upload annotation files for viewing. I wrote a tool
to do this. It's a single HTML file with some Javascript. Open it in your
favorite browser, point it to a PubTator formatted file, and get viewing.

Each color represents a unique label ID. Hover over an annotation to see the ID.
